### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ali Zolfaghari Sichani


- I have obtained both my bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degrees in mechanical engineering in one of the top-ranked universities in Iran, with a focus on computational thermo-fluid dynamics.
- In my bachelorâ€™s thesis, I developed a code in C++ for analyzing heat exchange phenomena in a double pipe heat exchanger.
- In my masterâ€™s thesis, I developed a code with FORTRAN to simulate bubble expansion for medical purposes. For this project, I created an adaptive mesh to ensure the most accurate results. In addition, I set up and carried out experimental tests to validate the numerical results.
- After graduation, I started working as a CFD code developer and R&D engineer. During this period I gathered valuable experience in this field. 
- I am interested in code development for mathematical modeling of physical processes. I have accomplished numerous projects over the past eight years, where I have written thousands of lines of codes in FORTRAN, C/C++, C#, MATLAB, etc.
In these projects I have always tried to develop creative algorithms for solving particular problems. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary environments so I have been involved in different fields namely medical (tumor and cancer), civil engineering, agriculture (water management), etc.
I enjoy exploring new ideas, particularly with the aim of implementing them to improve peopleâ€™s lives worldwide.
