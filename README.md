### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ali Zolfaghari Sichani


I have obtained both my bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degrees in mechanical engineering in one of the top-ranked universities in Iran, with a focus on computational thermo-fluid dynamics (CFD). I am interested in code development for mathematical modeling of physical processes. I have accomplished numerous projects over my experiences, where I have written thousands of lines of codes in FORTRAN, C/C++, C#, MATLAB, etc.


Some of my skills are:
* Programming Language: FORTRAN, C#, C++, Visual Basic
* Parallel Programming: MPI, Open MP
* Programming IDE: Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Visual Studio, QT Creator
* CFD Software: Star CCM+, ANSYS Fluent
* Mathematical Software: MATLAB, EES, MAPLE
* 3D Part Design Software: Solidworks 
* Operating Systems: Linux, Windows
* Other: Microsoft Office, Tecplot, ASPEN HTFS, HTRI Exchanger
